# model-selection
A hands-on exploration of advanced model selection techniques in machine learning, including k-fold cross-validation, GridSearchCV, validation curves, and learning curves. It shows using scikit-learn on real and synthetic datasets to diagnose overfitting, underfitting, and optimize hyperparametersâ€”ensuring reliable models for production.
